# locally by copying this file to top directory of the project.
# The `_clang-format` file must also be copied to the top directory of the

#    cp tools/whitespace_commit_checker.sh whitespace_commit_checker.sh
#    ./whitespace_commit_checker.sh

# This only checks C/C++ files committed as in the last code commit.
# See tools/README if for instructions on how to run clang-format on more code
